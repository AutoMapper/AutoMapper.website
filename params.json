{"name":"AutoMapper","tagline":"A convention-based object-object mapper. 100% organic and gluten-free. Takes out all of the fuss of mapping one object to another.","body":"### What is AutoMapper?\r\nAutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another. This type of code is rather dreary and boring to write, so why not invent a tool to do it for us?\r\n\r\n### How do I get started?\r\nCheck out the [getting started guide](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki/Getting-started). When you're done there, the [wiki](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki) goes in to the nitty-gritty details. Finally, check out the [dnrTV episode](http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=155) for a full walkthrough.\r\n\r\n### Where can I get it?\r\nFirst, [install NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget). Then, install AutoMapper from the package manager console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPM> Install-Package AutoMapper\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-25283083-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
