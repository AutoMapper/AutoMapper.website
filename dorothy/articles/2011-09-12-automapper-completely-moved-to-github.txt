title: AutoMapper completely moved to GitHub

AutoMapper is now completely moved to GitHub:

[AutoMapper GitHub](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper)

I've updated the site on CodePlex to reflect this move, and moved all existing content over:

* All issues have been moved to the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/issues)
* All wiki pages have been moved to the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki). 
* All downloads have been replicated on the [GitHub downloads page](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/downloads)

Having all of the project-level information in one spot will make it easier to manage. I'm not going to delete the CodePlex site, but I will not monitor that site going forward.
