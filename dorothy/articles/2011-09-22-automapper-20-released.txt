## New Features
* Targeting .NET 4 Client Profile
* Support for Silverlight 4
* Auto-projecting LINQ queries
* Nested/child container support
* Map to destination type constructors
* Derived type maps inherit base map configuration

## Enhancements

* Fully on NuGet
* Resolvers can dynamically ignore mapping
* Specfying mapping depth for recursive maps
* Many inheritance/polymorphism scenarios
* ReadOnlyCollection support
* ISet support

## Breaking changes

* Configuration class renamed to ConfigurationStore

## Bug Fixes

* Thread safetiness
* Private setters in base classes
* Nullable enums

As a reminder, [AutoMapper is on GitHub](https://github.com/automapper/automapper) now, so all issues should be reported there. Enjoy!
